                <p>
                    I’m a born and raised Wisconsinite through and through. I cheer for the Green and Gold, but the Brewers are my team of choice. My father taught me to hunt and fish when I was very young and it has stuck with me along with a love of the outdoors. He also brought home his work laptop when I was in grade school and made the mistake of letting me play with it. That’s how I got hooked. My brother and I would take turns sitting on our 80s orange and tan floral print couch playing Doom, Minesweeper, and eventually Warcraft and Command and Conquer. From there I learned how to do formulas and charts in Excel (I would track my allowance and project how a raise would affect how many packs of baseball or Magic the Gathering cards I could buy).

                    In high school I learned html, databases, and started writing code. More importantly, I met the girl who is now my wife our Junior year. Our first date was on Homecoming and we haven’t parted since. After high school I attended the University of Wisconsin – Whitewater for 4 years where I graduated summa cum laude with a MBA in Management of Computer Systems. That led to my first job in IT as a Software Developer at QuadGraphics on the Job Planning team. I cut my teeth writing PowerBuilder code with a Sybase database backend. I learned a lot about how software really gets made and was introduced to the Agile methodology. I was selected along with one other person to travel to Poland for two weeks to design the integration of our software with a recently acquired company. It was a great experience that taught me a lot about other cultures and thinking at a global level.

                    After 4 1/2 years I left Quad to join Badger Mutual Insurance in Milwaukee at the coaxing of a friend. They were about to lose one member of their team due to retirement and he thought that I would be a good fit. Going from a company with 100 developers to a company with 100 people and a 4 person IT team was quite a difference. Both kinds of companies have their unique challenges, but there is something about the small business that has really grown on me. It’s a great feeling to be able to talk to the President of the company every day and actually have your thoughts and opinions heard and taken into consideration. I felt like I had a real investment in the company and that the actions and decisions I made actually affected the bottom line of the company. It’s a powerful yet scary thing. I have a lot of confidence in my abilities but I don’t want to cross the fine line into arrogance. A little self doubt that makes you always double check your work is a good thing that I don’t want to lose.

                    Two hours of driving a day took its toll on me and after 5 years I found a job closer to home. Manitou is a French company that purchased a Wisconsin based company. On my first trip to the headquarters in France I was able to use some vacation and my wife flew out to meeet me. We spent a week in Paris and it was an incredible experience. On another trip I was able to tour Normandy and see many historic WWII sites. It's amazing what the soldiers of that time did in the face of such danger. I don't think we can ever be thankful enough.

                    On the personal side I have a daughter, a son, one dog and two horses. Heidi was born on Star Wars Day 2020! I hope that means the force will be strong with that one. Corbin was born in March of 2022 to complete our family. Darcy is a Labrador – Poodle mix (Labradoodle) that we got from a rescue in Missouri. She loves to play with a tennis ball and cuddle. It’s a deadly combination that has me wrapped around her tail. Reina Beatrix is a Thoroughbred and Shire mix while Fairfax is an off the track Thoroughbred. My wife, Christy, does Eventing and I am slowly learning Dressage. It’s really quite impressive to watch Christy ride and jump. In 2015 we built our dream house and barn in Slinger and we love having the horses right outside our window.

                    I created and ran a website for a local dartball league that I participated in. People could view schedules and scores online. If they created an account they could edit their personal information and stats. If they were given the Manager role they could also enter and correct scores for their team and stats for individual players.

                    The object of the 2013 <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/basescoded/index.jsp" target="_blank">MLBAM Bases Coded Challenge</a> is to submit an original baseball-themed gaming product to be developed using certain data and other materials provided by MLBAM. A panel of judges that will include staff members of MLB Advanced Media, L.P. and one or more industry experts will select the most compelling submissions.

                    I was a finalist and selected as a runner-up in the competition for creating and presenting a web application for MLBAM. In one month I designed, wrote and delivered a mobile game based on player and team comparisons that might get turned into a new web application for MLBAM.
