            Personal Side
My name is Derek Schwechel, and welcome to my site. I'll admit that this is a rip-off of my first blog post, but anything worth doing is worth copying and pasting right? Anyway, read on if you don't follow my blog and learn a thing or two about me.

I’m a born and raised Wisconsinite through and through. Of course I cheer for the Green and Gold, but the Brewers are my team of choice. My father taught me to hunt and fish when I was very young and it has stuck with me along with a love of the outdoors. He also brought home his work laptop when I was in grade school and made the mistake of letting me play with it. That’s how I got hooked. My brother and I would take turns sitting on our 80s orange and tan floral print couch playing Doom, Minesweeper, and eventually Warcraft and Command and Conquer. From there I learned how to do formulas and charts in Excel (I would track my allowance and project how a raise would affect how many packs of baseball cards I could buy).

In high school I learned html, databases, and the beginnings of writing code. More importantly, I met the girl who is now my wife our Junior year. Our first date was on Homecoming and we haven’t parted since. After high school I attended the University of Wisconsin – Whitewater for 4 years where I graduated summa cum laude with a MBA in Management of Computer Systems. That led to my first job in IT as a Software Developer at QuadGraphics on the Job Planning team. I cut my teeth writing PowerBuilder code with a Sybase database backend. I learned a lot about how software really gets made and met a lot of nice people. I was selected along with one other person to travel to Poland for two weeks to designed the integration of our software with a recently acquired company. It was a great experience that taught me a lot about other cultures and thinking at a global level.

After 4 1/2 years I left Quad to join Badger Mutual Insurance in Milwaukee at the coaxing of a friend. They were about to lose one member of their team due to retirement and he thought that I would be a good fit. Going from a company with 100 developers to a company with 100 people and a 4 person IT team was quite a challenge, but a welcome one. Both kinds of companies have their unique challenges, but there is something about the small business that has really grown on me. It’s a great feeling to be able to talk to the President of the company every day and actually have your thoughts and opinions heard and taken into consideration. I feel like I have a real investment in the company and that the actions and decisions I make will actually affect the bottom line of the company. It’s a powerful yet scary thing. I have a lot of confidence in my abilities but I don’t want to cross the fine line into arrogance. A little self doubt that makes you always double check your work is a good thing that I don’t want to lose.

On the personal side I have one dog, Darcy, and one horse, Reina Beatrix. Darcy is a Labrador – Poodle mix (Labradoodle) that we got from a rescue in Missouri. She is an only child that is irresistibly cute and she knows it. It’s a deadly combination that has me wrapped around her tail. Reina is a Thoroughbred and Shire mix. My wife, Christy, does Eventing with her. It’s really quite impressive to watch. Right now we currently board her at the house of the same friend who stole me away to Badger Mutual, but that will soon change. We recently finished building our dream house in Slinger and are about to start on the barn.
